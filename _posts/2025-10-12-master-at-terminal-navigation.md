Here is a concise note on useful Linux terminal keybindings for command line editing and navigation.

Navigating and editing commands efficiently in the Linux terminal can save a lot of time. Here are some essential keybindings:

- **Ctrl + A**: Move cursor to the beginning of the line.
- **Ctrl + E**: Move cursor to the end of the line.
- **Alt + B**: Move cursor backward by one word.
- **Alt + F**: Move cursor forward by one word.
- **Ctrl + U**: Delete from cursor to the beginning of the line.
- **Ctrl + K**: Delete from cursor to the end of the line.
- **Ctrl + W**: Delete the word before the cursor.
- **Ctrl + Y**: Paste (yank) the last deleted text.
- **Ctrl + D**: Delete the character under the cursor.
- **Ctrl + H**: Backspace (delete character before cursor).
- **Ctrl + L**: Clear the terminal screen (similar to `clear` command).
- **Ctrl + R**: Reverse search command history.
- **Ctrl + C**: Cancel the current command/line.
- **Ctrl + Z**: Suspend the current process.
- **Tab**: Autocomplete commands and filenames.

These shortcuts work in most Linux shells like Bash and Zsh, helping to edit commands faster and navigate efficiently.
