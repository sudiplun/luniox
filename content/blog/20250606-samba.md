Make sure you have `samba` package install and running `smb` daemon
and allow samba from firewall

edit on smb.conf

```bash
sudo vim /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

### Example

```bash
[global]
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   server string = Samba Server %v
   netbios name = arch
   security = user
   map to guest = bad user
   dns proxy = no

 # Logging
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   max log size = 1000
   log level = 1

[movie]
   comment = My Shared Directory
   path = /home/username/Videos
   browsable = yes
   writable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0655
   directory mask = 0755
   valid users = username
   public = no
   printable = no
   force user = username
   force group = username
```

to access from another device on local network check your device ip with   `ip a |grep inet`
see the output like this
```bash
inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
inet6 ::1/128 scope host noprefixroute
inet 192.168.1.78/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlan0
---------------
```
and my ip is 192.168.1.78 && your might be different

## Bonus
### add user to samba
`smbpasswd -a username`
### lock user with password
`smbpasswd username`

this will asked to enter new password for username

asked AI if get confused hehe....!
