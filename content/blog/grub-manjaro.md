on Manjaro, if you make `GRUB_TIMEOUT=0` or `GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="Manjaro"` it doesn't boot to default OS.instead set timeout for `10s` It's simple you have to make `GRUB_TIMEOUT=0` üòê huh..! It did not work.
so think about it...Actually by stop looking for OS by `GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true` this line on your grub.
Manjora did an excellent job by writing everything out already; all that remains is to uncomment it.
